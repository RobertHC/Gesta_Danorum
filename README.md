# Gesta_Danorum
My LaTeX formatting of Saxo's Gesta Danorum

### Version History ###
1.0
The first draft, including the first nine books and some historical context. The formatting includes hyperlinks for the table of contents and footnotes.

### Rationale ###
I decided to make this document in LaTeX because when I tried to read it on the Gutenberg Project website, it gave me a headache. So to read it more comfortably, I decided to grab the text from the Gutenberg website, www.gutenberg.org, and make it into a .pdf. After a few tries, I managed to get it into a good, readable state.

### Usage Restrictions ###
None! Feel free to download and use it as you see fit.
